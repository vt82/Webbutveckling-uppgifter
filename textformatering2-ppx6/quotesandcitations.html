There's much written on www about history of the
Internet. For example, about the first graphical Internet
browser on the web - Mosaic.
<blockquote> 
Mosaic is the first widely-used graphical
World Wide Web browser, released on April 22,
1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina.
A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later.
</blockquote>                
<q>Today's Internet browsers we use today
(e.g., Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.),</q>
got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser.
